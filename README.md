> This repository contains all data stucturing and analysis from a graduate research on social linguistic variations.

## ABOUT THE RESEARCH
"This research aims to analyze the linguistic and identity properties of undergraduate students at the State University of Londrina, employing the theoretical and methodological principles of Variationist Sociolinguistics. Additionally, it seeks to describe the linguistic variety of these students, considering phonetic and phonological aspects, as well as the implications of these phenomena in interaction within a geographically diverse environment where different linguistic variants are present. To achieve the proposed objectives, data were collected from students in their first and final years of undergraduate programs. These data were stratified to analyze the linguistic patterns of academic discourse. Understanding these patterns could offer insights into the social dynamics within academic communities, shedding light on how language functions as a tool for identity construction and social interaction." - Ana Paula Silva
