> This repository contains all data stucturing and analysis from a graduate research on social linguistic variations.

## ABOUT THE RESEARCH
"This research aims to analyze the linguistic and identity properties of undergraduate students at the State University of Londrina, employing the theoretical and methodological principles of Variationist Sociolinguistics. Additionally, it seeks to describe the linguistic variety of these students, considering phonetic and phonological aspects, as well as the implications of these phenomena in interaction within a geographically diverse environment where different linguistic variants are present. To achieve the proposed objectives, data were collected from students in their first and final years of undergraduate programs. These data were stratified to analyze the linguistic patterns of academic discourse. Understanding these patterns could offer insights into the social dynamics within academic communities, shedding light on how language functions as a tool for identity construction and social interaction." - Ana Paula Silva

## PHENOMENON

"The four most productive were selected for this analysis: palatalization of /t/ and /d/; rhotic variants; /s/ as a plural marker; and deletion of /d/ in the gerund.

For the palatalization of /t/ (tia ~ tʃia) and /d/ (dia ~ dʒia), the analysis focused on the context following alveolar stops, considering whether they were followed by /i/. It was hypothesized that when the speaker chooses to pronounce /i/, they would also use [dʒ], and with the vowel /e/, they would prefer [d]. Additionally, the position in the word—beginning, middle, or end—was also examined. 

Regarding the deletion of /d/ in the gerund (cantando ~ cantan∅o), the goal was to verify the consistent presence of this process in the academic discourse, analyzing it based on social variables.

To investigate /s/ as a plural marker (vamos ~ vamo∅), two linguistic analysis criteria were established. Following Scherre (1978; 1988), the elimination of plural markers generally occurs only in determiners or elements in the first position. Therefore, the position of the word in the phrase was chosen as the first criterion. For the second criterion, the following context was examined to test the hypothesis that /s/ initiating the next word would favor the presence of /s/ as a plural marker for the previous word (a[s] saias).

Rhotic variants, on the other hand, were required to be in the coda position (partir), medial, or final. It's important to note that final syllable coda contexts with resyllabification and the occurrence of the tap variant as a result of /r/ ceasing to be a coda and becoming an onset, as in "mar aberto," were excluded from the analysis. The occurrence of deletion (comer ~ come∅) was also examined to test the hypothesis of a gradation in rhotic deletion. The analysis categorized words based on their size and the position of /r/ in the word: beginning, middle, or end. Furthermore, words were divided into two categories: verb and noun." - Ana Paula Silva
